I completed this project after self-study looking further into Flexbox. I matched the redline spec document as closely as possible. The redline spec had a darker opacity then 0.9 produced live.
I feel I have a better understanding of Flexbox but certainly need further practice with it.
Opacity 1 is default so I did not include this in the code.
Based on the example I was given, I chose to make the width 1260px. This may not be correct but it was the decision I made based on the image.
